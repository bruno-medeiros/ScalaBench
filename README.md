### Essential reading:

#### Concurrency
 * https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/basics.html - 
 particularly notes about "Asynchronous / Semantic blocking"
 * https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/46b543800958cf61af6efa8e072bfd5c - types of thread pools in JVM   

#### Testing:
 * https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html - good contrast between "classical and mockist" styles of TDD.
 Also terminology and description for the various kinds of test doubles. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double
